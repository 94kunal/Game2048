# Game2048

It is a Game 2048 in which we add similar numbers in Grids to make a cell of 2048.

For the GUI, python tkinter library is been used which can be installed by using the below command:
    pip install future
 
Every move adds a random 2 at a random position
For the moves below keys are used:
    move up using keyboard key "w", 
    move down using keyboard key "s", 
    move left using keyboard key "a", 
    move right using keyboard key "d"
    
The Game is won once a cell has 2048 number and when there are no moves left, the Game is Over.
